# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment, no official releases have been made yet, so no version is officially supported yet.  
Keep in mind that nightly builds are not guaranteed to be stable and are not supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in the project, we kindly ask you to report it privately to the
security team by messaging us on [Discord](https://lyzev.github.io/discord).

Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been fixed. Our security team will review all reports and
work to quickly address any potential security issues.

You can expect to receive an update within a reasonable time frame on the status of your report and when a fix has been
released.

We take all reports of security vulnerabilities very seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our project secure.
